# 🚀 React Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a series of short but impactful React.js projects to strengthen core concepts and build reusable components. Each project is focused on a specific UI pattern or functionality often used in real-world applications.

## 📚 Projects Included

1. **Accordion**  
   A collapsible accordion component to display FAQs or grouped content efficiently using conditional rendering and state toggling.

2. **Random Color Generator**  
   Generates random background or text colors with a single click, helping understand useState and color manipulation in React.

3. **Star Rating Component**  
   An interactive star rating system used for feedback forms or reviews. Demonstrates dynamic rendering and user interaction handling.

4. **Image Slider**  
   A carousel/slider to navigate through images with arrows or auto-play. Reinforces state management and transitions.

5. **Load More Button**  
   A pattern for progressive content loading. Useful for rendering data chunks with "Load More" pagination.

6. **Tree View / Menu UI (Recursive Navigation Menu)**  
   Builds a dynamic recursive navigation menu using nested JSON data. A great exercise in recursive component rendering and data structure traversal.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React.js** (with Hooks)
- CSS Modules / Plain CSS
